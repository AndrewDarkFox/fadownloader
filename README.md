#Furaffinity Downloader

***

This was made for personal use, but decided to upload just in case someone else finds it useful.

Usage:
```bash
./fadownloader.rb tojo-the-thief
```

Downloads all pictures from Tojo-The-Thief's gallery.

Default download path is $HOME/Pictures/FADownloader, but you can override that via `--download-directory <dir>` parameter.
